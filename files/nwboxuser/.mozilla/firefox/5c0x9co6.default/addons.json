It also works with most video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe and thousands others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, MP2T, F4F, â€¦ Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is also able to capture directly from the screen and generate a video file out of it.\n\nAs a bonus, Video DownloadHelper can also record Twitter Periscope. Just specify search terms and the add-on will capture over night related live streams.\n\nAs another bonus, you can also use Video DownloadHelper to capture a full browsing session, optionally highlighting the mouse position and generate a video file out of it. This is ideal to create Web a site demos as a video.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also able to make video conversion (changing audio and video formats) and aggregation (joining separate audio and video to a single file) very easy. This is a commercial feature that helps paying for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from web sites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nWhen you first install the extension, your browser is redirected to a welcome page with links to a user manual at http://www.downloadhelper.net/howto.php.\n\nThis does not change your homepage setting and the welcome page won't appear anymore.\n\nYou may want to watch this video about using Video DownloadHelper 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhqUx-b5-bE\n\nSupport can be obtained from http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php.\n\nIf you want to test developments version, check this forum https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/video-downloadhelper-5.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), Google + or Facebook.\n\nIf you enjoy the free service from Video DownloadHelper, we would appreciate a donation (or BTC: 1Eqe8DN6uJwVcHoqyfCPpMy6Q5FzjqcWLZ) or leave a nice review here or on any other media.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"200","height":"150","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"327","height":"124","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"76","caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"250","height":"200","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"188","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"361","height":"289","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"187","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"320","height":"317","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"151","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"293","height":"250","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"176","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/475731/video_downloadhelper-6.0.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":710273,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":6800,"totalDownloads":212647298,"weeklyDownloads":262869,"dailyUsers":3956003,"updateDate":1470159045000,"supportURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php"},{"id":"{5384767E-00D9-40E9-B72F-9CC39D655D6F}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/45/45281-32.png?modified=1470395932","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/45/45281-64.png?modified=1470395932"},"name":"EPUBReader","type":"extension","version":"1.5.0.8","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"epubreader","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/epubreader/?src=api"},"description":"With EPUBReader you can read ePub files just in Firefox.
