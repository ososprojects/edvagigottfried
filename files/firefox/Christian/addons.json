It also works with most video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe and thousands others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, MP2T, F4F, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is also able to capture directly from the screen and generate a video file out of it.\n\nAs a bonus, Video DownloadHelper can also record Twitter Periscope. Just specify search terms and the add-on will capture over night related live streams.\n\nAs another bonus, you can also use Video DownloadHelper to capture a full browsing session, optionally highlighting the mouse position and generate a video file out of it. This is ideal to create Web a site demos as a video.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also able to make video conversion (changing audio and video formats) and aggregation (joining separate audio and video to a single file) very easy. This is a commercial feature that helps paying for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from web sites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nWhen you first install the extension, your browser is redirected to a welcome page with links to a user manual at http://www.downloadhelper.net/howto.php.\n\nThis does not change your homepage setting and the welcome page won't appear anymore.\n\nYou may want to watch this video about using Video DownloadHelper 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhqUx-b5-bE\n\nSupport can be obtained from http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php.\n\nIf you want to test developments version, check this forum https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/video-downloadhelper-5.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), Google + or Facebook.\n\nIf you enjoy the free service from Video DownloadHelper, we would appreciate a donation (or BTC: 1GTbxARC2mmxKDhsr3g7EZV5xaAFvNCsZk) or leave a nice review here or on any other media.\n\n************************************************************\n\nSince May 2014, the VDH reviews are being trolled. Given the history of those reviews, that started with simple pure spamming, we assume this is done by a competitor selling a Windows application.\n\nThose reviews generally claim to love the previous 4.x versions and argue that releases 5.x, published in early March 2015, have those drawbacks:\n\n1- the new user interface is ugly\n2- the new UI is difficult to use\n3- you must install a converter to download videos\n4- you have to pay to download videos\n5- you have to pay to download YouTube videos\n6- the add-on does not work\n\nHowever, they forget to mention that:\n\n1- VDH5 introduced a new UI (user interface). Most prefer this new one as it shows more information than the previous interface based on a classic Firefox-integrated drop-down menu. But it’s perfectly OK to dislike this new UI. This is why we put an old style toolbar icon, we call the “companion” button, which acts pretty much the same way as in VDH4. So if you prefer the old-way interface, just use this button. We even made easy to hide the button giving access to the new UI so you won’t inadvertently trigger it.\n\n2- Well, all you have to do is click on the toolbar button then, in the list, on the name of the video you want to start the download. Can you really make simpler ? Of course, if you are an advanced user, there are many things you can customize in the add-on and it takes an expert to masterize every single parameter. It’s just that you probably don’t need to tune anything.\n\n3- In most cases, you won’t need the converter. But for some operations (see below), you may be requested to install this open source external application in order to perform manipulations on audio and video streams. It’s just that this type of job does not technically suit a pure browser add-on.\n\n4- VDH4 as well as VDH5 provide video download for free. But since we need to eat and we don’t want to sell our users data (just think to what are many “100% free” tools fed with), and donations are by far not sufficient (we thank our generous helpers by the way), we have provided extra services since 2008. Using VDH, you can convert videos to almost any format, and we provide a nice UI for doing so. You can try this conversion feature for free to see if it matches you needs, but the generated videos hold a watermark (a QR code on VDH5, used to be a logo on VDH4). Purchasing a license clears that limitation.\n\n5- For each video available on the YouTube platform, a number of variants (formats) are available. Some contains audio and video, some audio or video only. VDH4 could only download the audio+video variants. VDH5 too, but in addition it allows to download separately audio and video variants, and mix (aggregate) them into a single file you can easily use on your computer. When you choose to pick such a variant (called ADP), you need the converter and it is subject to the license as in 4 (because we needed so to make a living). So if you let away the ADP variants, you will get the exact same choices you had with VDH4.\n\n6- It works well for others and does what it says. Give it a try and make up your mind.\n\nIf you are in doubt whether a review is honest, look at the registration date of the author.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","width":"200","height":"150","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","width":"327","height":"124","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"76","caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","width":"250","height":"200","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","thumbnailWidth":"188","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","width":"361","height":"289","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","thumbnailWidth":"187","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","width":"320","height":"317","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","thumbnailWidth":"151","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","width":"293","height":"250","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.png?src=api&modified=1426285267","thumbnailWidth":"176","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/361160/video_downloadhelper-5.4.2-fx.xpi?src=api","size":623166,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":5841,"totalDownloads":201622410,"weeklyDownloads":296978,"dailyUsers":4732362,"updateDate":1446158699000,"supportURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php"},{"id":"langpack-en-ZA@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6180-32.png?modified=1358380391","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6180-64.png?modified=1358380391"},"name":"English (South African) Language Pack","type":"locale","version":"42.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Dwayne Bailey","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/dwayne-bailey/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Translate.org.za","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/translateorgza/?src=api"},{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"}],"description":"Adds South African English language support to the Firefox browser.

Additionally, this extension will disable all hyperlinks to these websites, by just displaying the link text without the clicking functionality.","fullDescription":"Blocking sites/white list problem\nIf you are having trouble with blocking websites you don't want to block, all you need to do is switch to a Black List and you will be fine. Please address any questions to our support page. We check your suggestions every day:\nhttp://www.wips.com/support/block-site-addon\n\n\nGeneral usage\nYou can add and/or remove websites, you don't want to visit ever again, via the BlockSite Preferences. You can open this window by clicking on the options button of BlockSite in Tools > Add-ons menu, or by clicking on the Preferences item in the context menu of the extension in the Extension Manager.\n\nWildcards\nYou can block whole ranges of websites by using the wildcard symbol (*):\nIf you want to block, for example, a lot of Microsoft websites, you can use the following line: \"http://*.microsoft.*\" and \"http://microsoft.*\" The * symbol indicates that there may be zero or more random characters at that place.\n\nImport/Export\nYou can import and export lists of locations via the 'Import' and 'Export' buttons in the 'BlockSite Preferences' window. The first line in the file you want to import has to be the '[BlockSite]' in order to be read succesfully. So your file may look like:\n\n[BlockSite]\nhttp://*.domain.*\nhttp://test.com*\n...\n\nIf you still use Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.*, you can use older versions of this extension.\n\nPassword protection\nIf you lost your password: go to about:config (type about:config in the location bar and press enter) and reset the BlockSite.authenticate entry or clear the BlockSite.password entry.\n\nProblems\nSome problems were reported about the loading latency whenever a very long list of blocked urls has to be checked. Every web site often makes more than ten HTTP calls and on every call, the long list of urls is checked. It's quite obvious and I probably won't change it.\n\nAbout the developer\nWips.com is a team of developer enthusiastic to Chrome Extensions and Mozilla Add-ons. We love developing extensions for users and we are happy to hear new ideas and any feedback from you. That is why you can write us on info@wips.com anytime and be sure that we will reply.
